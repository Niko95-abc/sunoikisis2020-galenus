# URNs to experiment with the CITE app

To find your way around and get a feeling for how CITE / CEX work, follow these steps:

1. In your browser, open the CITE App page
2. When the page loads, select "Choose a local .cex file" ("Browse" button)
3. Navigate to the cite/cextexts directory
4. Select any file ending in `.cex`; for this demonstration, select isocratis-panegyricus-47r2.cex
5. In the CITE App, on the "Browse Texts" tab (opens by default), paste into the pane before the "Retrieve Passage" button, one by one, the following URNs: ```
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0010.tlg011.ffzghr-pos.token:47.1.31 urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0010.tlg011.ffzghr-pos.token:47.1.5 urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0010.tlg011.ffzghr-pos.token:47.1
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0010.tlg011.ffzghr-pos.token:47.1.200-47.1.201
```
6. Think about how the URNs function
7. Click on the "See All Versions of Passage" button; see what happens, think about it
8. Try the "Retrieve Passage" button with the following URNs:
```
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0010.tlg011.ffzghr-pos.lemma:47.1.200-47.1.201
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0010.tlg011.ffzghr-pos.postag:47.1.200-47.1.201
```
9. Study the URNs above and notice what is different
10. In the "Relations" tab, paste the following URN into the "Find URNs in Relations" pane: `urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0010.tlg011.ffzghr-pos.token:47.1.200`
